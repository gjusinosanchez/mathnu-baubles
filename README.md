# mathnu-baubles
 A collection of Mathematica notebooks featuring some neutrino calculations and visualizations.
 The notebooks are uncommented and perhaps hard to parse.

-sterile mixing contours: A joint T2K + NOvA calculation using grid search to plot contourts for \theta_{14} 
 and \theta_{24}. It assumes either NOvA's best-fit points or nuFits for no particularly good reason.

-Parallezied (NOvA+T2K) Sim: Roughly checks if the simulation can somewhat reproduce the results
 from the neutrino 2020 conference.

-neutrino_dynamic: A neat interactive file and lets you play with neutrino oscillations 
 starting at the basics and ending with neutrinos and anti-neutrinos at NOvA.

-sterile vacuum info: A collection of really messy vacuum oscillation formulas, matrix elements,
 and matrix elements squared for 3 neutrinos + 1 extra neutrino in vacuum.
